##Web Programming with Python and JavaScript: Pinnochio’s Pizza&Subs Web Application.

This web application allows client users to view Pinnochio’s Pizza&Subs menu, register personal user account and log in with created account credentials. Once logged in, an user can select pizza's toppings and extras, add them to the cart and place an order.
The contents of user's order is backed up in SQLite database, so it is possible for an user to resume his/her shopping even after browser session was closed or interrupted.
After order is placed, email confirmation is sent to user's email containing all order details. Additionally, when order is completed and handled for delivery, another email notification is sent to an user.
The application provides ability for users to view their order history.

Pinnochio’s Pizza&Subs stuff users can log in, view all order details and mark orders as completed.
SQLite database is configured to allow stuff users to perform CRUD operations for menu items or change their prices.
